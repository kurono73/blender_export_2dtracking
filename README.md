# Blender 2D exporter to popular matchmove app format
## A blender tool that export Syntheyes, 3DE, PFtrack format

Does anyone here know how to create a blender plugin?

I hire a guy to write an blender 2D track exporter for me, few year ago (it's in python) It can export to **Syntheyes, 3DE, PFtrack** and maybe some others format (can't remember for sure)

I didn't want to spend more money on it to have him maintain the script (Update to current version of blender) Since I'm out of the matchmove space for sometime now. I'm pretty sure it work with blender 2.77 or maybe 2.8
